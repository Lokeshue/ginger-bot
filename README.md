# Agentic AI Chatbot

An intelligent, agentic AI chatbot built with **Python, Streamlit, and OpenAI**, capable of autonomously deciding when to use tools such as web search, calculations, and note storage to complete user tasks. This project demonstrates practical implementation of **agentic AI systems**, tool orchestration, and conversational UI design.

##  Features

- **Agentic Reasoning** – The chatbot decides when and how to use tools
- **Tool Calling**
  -  Web search (DuckDuckGo)
  - Calculator
  - Note saving & retrieval (session memory)
- **Interactive UI** built with Streamlit
- **Secure API handling** using environment variables
- Modular and extensible architecture

##  Why Agentic AI?

Unlike standard chatbots, this system:
- Plans actions
- Chooses tools autonomously
- Executes tasks
- Returns synthesized responses

This mimics real-world AI agent behavior used in:
- AI copilots
- Research assistants
- Workflow automation systems
- Decision support tools

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Streamlit** – UI
- **OpenAI API** – LLM + tool calling
- **DuckDuckGo Search API**
- **python-dotenv** – environment management
